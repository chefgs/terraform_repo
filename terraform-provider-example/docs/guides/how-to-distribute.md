# Sharing a Custom Terraform Provider with Users

When distributing your custom Terraform provider to users, there are several options available, ranging from manual local installation to publishing it in the Terraform Registry. Here's a comprehensive guide on the different approaches:

## Distribution Options

### Option 1: Pre-compiled Binary Distribution (Recommended for most users)

Users can download and use your provider without building it themselves. This is the most user-friendly approach.

1. **Build binaries for all target platforms**:
   - Build for various operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Build for various architectures (amd64, arm64)

2. **Create a release package** with:
   - Pre-compiled binaries
   - SHA256 checksums
   - Installation instructions

3. **Host the binaries** on:
   - GitHub Releases
   - Your own file server
   - Cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.)

### Option 2: Terraform Registry (Best for widely used providers)

If your provider is mature and intended for broader usage:

1. Publish your provider to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)
2. Users can then reference it directly in their Terraform configurations

### Option 3: Private Registry

For enterprise environments with controlled distribution:

1. Set up a private Terraform registry
2. Users configure Terraform to use your private registry

## User Installation Instructions

Here are the steps users need to follow to install your custom provider:

### For Pre-compiled Binary (Manual Installation)

1. **Download the appropriate binary** for their platform
2. **Create the plugins directory** (if it doesn't exist):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/chefgs/example/1.0.0/$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')
   ```

3. **Copy the provider binary** to the plugins directory:

   ```bash
   cp terraform-provider-example ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/chefgs/example/1.0.0/$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')
   ```

4. **Make the binary executable** (for Unix-like systems):

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/chefgs/example/1.0.0/$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/')/terraform-provider-example
   ```

### For Registry-based Installation

If your provider is in the Terraform Registry or a private registry, users simply need to reference it in their Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    example = {
      source  = "chefgs/example"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
terraform init
```

## Distribution Package Contents

A complete distribution package should include:

1. **Pre-compiled binaries** for major platforms:
   - Linux (amd64, arm64)
   - macOS (amd64, arm64)
   - Windows (amd64)

2. **Documentation**:
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Provider configuration reference
   - Resource documentation

3. **Verification files**:
   - SHA256 checksums
   - GPG signature (optional but recommended)

## Automating the Release Process

You can automate the build and release process using GitHub Actions. Here's a simplified workflow:

1. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that:
   - Builds binaries for all target platforms
   - Creates checksums
   - Uploads artifacts to GitHub Releases
   - Generates documentation

2. Tag your repository with a new version to trigger the release

This automates the distribution process and ensures consistency across releases.

## Best Practices for Provider Distribution

1. **Version your provider** using semantic versioning
2. **Document breaking changes** clearly between versions
3. **Include example configurations** to help users get started
4. **Provide clear installation instructions** for different platforms
5. **Sign your releases** for security verification
6. **Test the installation process** on different platforms before release

## Summary

Users do not need to build your provider from source if you provide pre-compiled binaries for their platform. The recommended approach is to distribute pre-built binaries for all major platforms, which users can download and place in their local Terraform plugins directory.

For a more integrated experience, publishing to the Terraform Registry provides the best user experience, allowing users to reference your provider directly in their Terraform configurations without manual installation steps.
